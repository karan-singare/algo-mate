# Phi-3 Mini-4K-Instruct ONNX models

<!-- Provide a quick summary of what the model is/does. -->
This repository hosts the optimized versions of [Phi-3-mini-4k-instruct](https://aka.ms/phi3-mini-4k-instruct) to accelerate inference with ONNX Runtime.

Phi-3 Mini is a lightweight, state-of-the-art open model built upon datasets used for Phi-2 - synthetic data and filtered websites - with a focus on very high-quality, reasoning dense data. The model belongs to the Phi-3 model family, and the mini version comes in two variants: 4K and 128K which is the context length (in tokens) it can support. The model underwent a rigorous enhancement process, incorporating both supervised fine-tuning and direct preference optimization to ensure precise instruction adherence and robust safety measures.

Optimized Phi-3 Mini models are published here in [ONNX](https://onnx.ai) format to run with [ONNX Runtime](https://onnxruntime.ai/) on CPU and GPU across devices, including server platforms, Windows, Linux and Mac desktops, and mobile CPUs, with the precision best suited to each of these targets.

[DirectML](https://aka.ms/directml) support lets developers bring hardware acceleration to Windows devices at scale across AMD, Intel, and NVIDIA GPUs. Along with DirectML, ONNX Runtime provides cross platform support for Phi-3 Mini across a range of devices for CPU, GPU, and mobile.

To easily get started with Phi-3, you can use our newly introduced ONNX Runtime Generate() API. See [here](https://aka.ms/generate-tutorial) for instructions on how to run it.

## ONNX Models 

Here are some of the optimized configurations we have added:  

1. ONNX model for int4 DML: ONNX model for AMD, Intel, and NVIDIA GPUs on Windows, quantized to int4 using [AWQ](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.00978).
2. ONNX model for fp16 CUDA: ONNX model you can use to run for your NVIDIA GPUs.
3. ONNX model for int4 CUDA: ONNX model for NVIDIA GPUs using int4 quantization via RTN.
4. ONNX model for int4 CPU and Mobile: ONNX model for CPU and mobile using int4 quantization via RTN. There are two versions uploaded to balance latency vs. accuracy.
   Acc=1 is targeted at improved accuracy, while Acc=4 is for improved perf. For mobile devices, we recommend using the model with acc-level-4.
   

More updates on AMD, and additional optimizations on CPU and Mobile will be added with the official ORT 1.18 release in early May. Stay tuned!

## How to Get Started with the Model
To make running of the Phi-3 models across a range of devices and platforms across various execution provider backends possible, we introduce a new API to wrap several aspects of generative AI inferencing. This API make it easy to drag and drop LLMs straight into your app. For running the early version of these models with ONNX Runtime, follow the steps [here](http://aka.ms/generate-tutorial).

For example:

```python
python model-qa.py -m /*{YourModelPath}*/onnx/cpu_and_mobile/phi-3-mini-4k-instruct-int4-cpu -k 40 -p 0.95 -t 0.8 -r 1.0
```

```
*Input:*  <|user|>Tell me a joke<|end|><|assistant|>

*Output:*  Why don't scientists trust atoms?
           Because they make up everything!

This joke plays on the double meaning of "make up." In science, atoms are the fundamental building blocks of matter, literally making up everything. However, in a colloquial sense, "to make up" can mean to fabricate or lie, hence the humor.
```
## Performance Metrics

<!-- These are the evaluation metrics being used, ideally with a description of why. -->
### DirectML on Windows
We measured the performance of DirectML and ONNX Runtime's new Generate() API with Phi-3 Mini quantized with Activation-Aware Quantization ([AWQ](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.00978)) and with a block size of 128 on Windows. Our test machine had an NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4090 GPU and an Intel Core i9-13900K CPU. DirectML lets developers not only achieve great performance but also lets developers deploy models across the entire Windows ecosystem with support from AMD, Intel, and NVIDIA. Best of all, AWQ means that developers get this scale while also maintaining high model accuracy.

Stay tuned for additional performance improvements in the coming weeks thanks to optimized drivers from our hardware partners, along with additional updates to the ONNX Runtime Generate() API.

## Appendix

### Activation Aware Quantization

AWQ works by identifying the top 1% most salient weights that are most important for maintaining accuracy and quantizing the remaining 99% of weights. This leads to less accuracy loss from quantization compared to many other quantization techniques. For more on AWQ, see [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.00978).
